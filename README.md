## Requirements
Run the following command in the console to install the requirements
```bash
pip install matplotlib PySimpleGUI opencv-python scipy scikit-image TiffCapture
```

## Usage (for now)
1. Run FlowJ.py
2. You will be prompted to choose a .tif file
3. CSF profiling will be ran, displaying plots and returning an array of the average velocities

### Testing parameters
Use the `ky.test_kymo_parms()` function to open a window to test different thresholds.
